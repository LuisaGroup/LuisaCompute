# Build Instructions

## Requirements

### C++

- CMake 3.20+
- C++ compilers with C++20 support (e.g., Clang-13, GCC-11, MSVC-17)
    - MSVC and Clang (with GNU-style command-line options) are recommended and tested on Windows

### Backends

- CUDA
    - CUDA 11.2 or higher
    - RTX-compatible graphics cards with appropriate drivers
- DirectX
    - DirectX 12 with ray tracing support
    - RTX-compatible graphics card with appropriate drivers
- ISPC
    - x86-64 CPU with AVX256 or Apple M1 CPU with ARM Neon
    - (Optional) LLVM 12+ with the corresponding targets and features enabled (for JIT executing the IR emitted by ISPC)
- Metal
    - macOS 12 or higher
    - Apple M1 chips are recommended (older GPUs are probably supported but not tested)
- LLVM
    - x86-64 CPU with AVX256 or Apple M1 CPU with ARM Neon
    - LLVM 12+ with the corresponding targets and features enabled

### Python

- Python 3.9+ (please pass the correct `-D Python_ROOT_DIR=<Python-install-dir>` option to CMake if you have multiple
  versions of Python installed)
- Packages: astpretty, dearpygui, sourceinspect, numpy, pillow
- Backend-specific requirements are the same as above

## CMake Flags

The ISPC backend is disabled by default. Other backends will automatically be enabled if the corresponding
APIs/frameworks are detected. You can override the default settings by specifying CMake flags manually, in
form of `-D FLAG=value` behind the first cmake command.

In case you need to run the ISPC backend, download the [ISPC compiler executable](https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html)
of your platform and copy the executable (e.g., `ispc` or `ispc.exe`) to `src/backends/ispc/ispc_support/` before
compiling. On Windows, if you wish to use the system compiler instead of LLVM-JIT with the ISPC backend, you have to
copy the `Hostx64/x64` version tools and libraries, `link.exe`, `msvcrt.lib`, and `mspdbcore.dll`,
to `src/backends/ispc/ispc_support/`, which come along with the Visual Studio installation and are used for dynamically
links the object files into shared libraries; on Linux/macOS, simply make sure `cc` is on your command-line and capable
of linking object files into shared libraries.

- `LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_CUDA`: Enable CUDA backend (Default: `ON`)
- `LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_DX`: Enable DirectX backend (Default: `ON`)
- `LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_ISPC`: Enable ISPC backend (Default: `OFF`)
- `LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_METAL`: Enable Metal backend (Default: `ON`)
- `LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_LLVM`: Enable LLVM backend (Default: `ON`)
- `LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_PYTHON`: Enable LuisaCompute Python (Default: `ON`)
- `LUISA_COMPUTE_ENABLE_GUI`: Enable GUI display in C++ tests (Default: `ON`)

## Build Commands

```bash
cmake  -S . -B <build-dir> -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # =Debug if you want a debug build; optionally followed by other flags as listed above
cmake --build <build-dir>
```

> Note: a typical choice of `<build-dir>` is `build`, as assumed the default in the `set_python_path.{bat|ps1|sh}`
> scripts to set `PYTHONPATH`. If it is not your case, please modify the scripts to export the correct paths.

## Running the Programs

1. LuisaCompute C++ tests are output to the `<build-dir>/bin` folder.
2. LuisaCompute Python tests are in the `src/py` directory. Run `set_python_path.{bat|ps1|sh}` (or manually with shell
   commands if you prefer) to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to `<build-dir>/bin` before running any python
   test, otherwise Python will fail to find and load the bindings exported from C++. To run `lrenderer.py`, copy files
   in `pyscenes` to the same directory of `lrenderer.py`.
4. All tests accept a command-line argument specifying backend, which can be chosen from `cuda`, `dx`, `ispc`, `metal`,
   and `llvm` (all in the lower case).
