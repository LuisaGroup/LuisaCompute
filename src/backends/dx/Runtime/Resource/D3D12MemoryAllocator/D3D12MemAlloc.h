When defined to value other than 0, the library will try to use
D3D12_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT or D3D12_SMALL_MSAA_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT
for created textures when possible, which can save memory because some small textures
may get their alignment 4K and their size a multiply of 4K instead of 64K.

#define D3D12MA_USE_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT 0
    Disables small texture alignment.
#define D3D12MA_USE_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT 1
    Enables conservative algorithm that will use small alignment only for some textures
    that are surely known to support it.
#define D3D12MA_USE_SMALL_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT 2
    Enables query for small alignment to D3D12 (based on Microsoft sample) which will
    enable small alignment for more textures, but will also generate D3D Debug Layer
    error #721 on call to ID3D12Device::GetResourceAllocationInfo, which you should just
    ignore.
